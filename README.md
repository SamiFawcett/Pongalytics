# Pongalytics
created to help me and my friend keep track of ping pong stats however, security is minimized.

don't know how to make this public using just file systems
Current Problem:
I don't know how to generalize file paths, I tried System.getProperty("user.home"); but the file still can't be found.
Current hold on project until I found out how this works. Help is needed :)
